This repository contains the presentation and the grammars from a tutorial on using the LinGO Grammar Matrix for the implementation of HPSG grammars:

Each file whose name begins with "choices" represents a different version of a grammar. These files were created with the LinGO Grammar Matrix customization system:

https://matrix.ling.washington.edu/customize/

To generate the LKB files of a grammar, first visit the LinGO Grammar Matrix customization system. Then upload a choices file by clicking on "Choose file" and "Create Grammar" at the botton of the page. Download the thusly created grammar files and store them in a local folder.
To test the grammar, run the script in the lkb folder with the LKB system (menu option LKB/Load/Complete grammar). Parse the test_sentences file to check which sentences the grammars parses. The output of the different versions of the grammars are stored in the files whose names begin with "out".
